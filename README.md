# Library App Using Firebase

This is an updated version of my library app that is using firebase.

## Project: Library

The project is from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-using-baas-for-your-back-end)

A **live preview** of the project is [here](https://lucasstinson.github.io/library-firebase).

### Overview

#### **Features:**

- A user has the ability to add, delete or update the read status on their books.
- Authentication and storage has been implemented with Firebase.
- A user can register an account with a simple email and password and store their entries online;

#### **Tools:**

#### **Areas of Improvement:**

- The application is on the simpler side and could have a few styling updates such as a toggleable darkmode.
- There is no local storage implemeneted for offline users. Refreshing the page will destroy the library
- The code is tightly coupled and should be refactored to clean up the code

### Assignment

1. Go back to one of the previous projects (e.g. the library project or the to-do app), and follow the Firebase setup guide to prepare it for interaction with a Firebase backend.
